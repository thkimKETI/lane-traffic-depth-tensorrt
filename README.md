# ðŸš˜ Lane, Traffic Object, and Depth Estimation on Jetson with TensorRT

**Real-time lane detection, traffic sign/light recognition, and monocular depth estimation using TensorRT on NVIDIA Jetson.**  
Developed as part of the [KIAT] Embedded AI-based Full Autonomous Driving (Level 4) SW and MaaS Technology Development Project.

## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository provides three major perception modules for autonomous driving:

- **Lane Detection**: Lightweight, anchor-based multi-lane detector  
- **Traffic Infrastructure Detection**: Real-time inference for traffic lights, signs, and road markings  
- **Monocular Depth Estimation**: CNN-based single-image depth map inference  

All models are optimized with **TensorRT** and designed to run on **NVIDIA Jetson platforms** (Orin, Xavier, etc).

## ðŸ”„ ONNX Model Conversion

Each model is also provided in ONNX format and can be converted to TensorRT using `trtexec` or Python API.

### Example (Using trtexec):

```bash
trtexec --onnx=weights/object/object.onnx --saveEngine=weights/object/object.engine --fp16
```

### Notes:

- Ensure your Jetson environment matches the ONNX conversion environment (TensorRT, CUDA, cuDNN)
- You can adjust input shape, workspace size, and precision as needed

---

### âœ… 2. Run demo

```bash
python ADSW_Release.py -v ./videos/SIHEUNG.mp4
```

## ðŸ“¦ TensorRT Engine Notes

- `.engine` files are already optimized models. You must regenerate them if:
  - You change your Jetson device (e.g., from Xavier to Orin)
  - Your TensorRT or CUDA version differs from the training machine
- See [TensorRT documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/developer-guide/index.html) for converting ONNX to TensorRT.
